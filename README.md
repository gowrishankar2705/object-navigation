# 🧭 Object Navigation

An AI-powered object navigation system leveraging YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and Text-To-Speech (TTS) for audio feedback, designed to assist in navigation tasks.

---

## 📘 About

This project combines advanced computer vision with speech synthesis to create a navigation assistant that detects surrounding objects using the YOLOv8 model and provides spoken guidance or alerts. It is implemented entirely in Python and supports real-time processing.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 neural network  
- Text-to-Speech integration for actionable audio navigation feedback  
- Efficient processing tailored for navigation use cases  
- Modular Python codebase for easy extension and customization  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **AI Framework:** PyTorch (YOLOv8 model)  
- **Speech Synthesis:** Any Python TTS library (e.g., pyttsx3, gTTS)  
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt`
